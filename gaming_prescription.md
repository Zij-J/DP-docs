## Notes

New games always have 新奇. How fast 新奇 fades off depends on how much "Exploration" the game emphasizes.

Games for 刺激 and 新奇 with lots of "New Moves" usually envolves to 成就感.

Game price listed from high to low:
1. 社交
2. 新奇
3. 休息
4. 刺激
5. 成就感

People play games for general "happiness" usually need 1. 2. more... \
Pay the price, be relieved (effectly + happily) and try to live a better life for free!  


To maximum 成就感 gain, two optimal playstyle is prefered:
1. Getting Better by figuring out more knowledge/more approach of the game.
2. Gapped training (sweet spot: long but not forget control, mine are 1 week) and halt before getting frustrated (mine are around 3 loss, so had better halt in 2) 

Others (like *keep trying for a good luck, daily practices, think about rewards*) will increase determination, win chance and skill, but they take *EFFORTS* with little positive feedback. \
Had better think **"Just not Fun enough!"**, clear mind and shift focus to something important or more Fun for the optimal gap in 2.!     
(So *having many things to do* is a blessing indeed)
