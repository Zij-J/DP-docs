## Notes

New games always have 新奇. How fast 新奇 fades off depends on how much "Exploration" the game emphasizes.

Games for 刺激 and 新奇 with lots of "New Moves" usually envolves to 成就感.

Game price listed from high to low:
1. 社交
2. 新奇
3. 休息
4. 刺激
5. 成就感

People play games for general "happiness" usually need 1. 2. more... \
Pay the price, be relieved (effectly + happily) and try to live a better life for free!
